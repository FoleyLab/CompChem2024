### Quick guide to submitting notebooks to Prof. Foley

Each computational lab has been designed such that all the work can be done on the ChemCompute jupyterhub server, so it will be easiest if you do all your work while connected to this server (all that is required is a computer with an internet connection and your WPUNJ login).  However, submission of completed 
assignments is not supported on the ChemCompute server at this time (at least not to my knowledge).  

For uniformity, please submit notebooks to Prof. Foley as google colab notebooks with edit permissions enabled for anyone with the link to the notebook.  The steps for submission are as follows:

- Save your completed notebook on the ChemCompute server with all of your answers typed in and your code-blocks executed so that all data / plots are displayed.

- Download your notebooks to your computer as a notebook (.ipynb extension)

- Upload your notebook into google colab and save a copy on your google drive

- Change the permissions on this google colab notebook so that "anyone with a link can edit"

- Email the link to foleyj10@wpunj.edu  with the title of the assignment in the subject line
