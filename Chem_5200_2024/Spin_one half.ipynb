    "## Eigenvalues and eigenvectors\n",
    "An important property of Hermitian matrices is that their eigevalues are real numbers.  In quantum mechanics, we associate the possible outcomes of measurements with the eigenvalues of Hermitian operators corresponding to the observable being measured.  In this notebook, we have been talking about the observable of spin angular momentum, which is a vector quantity. We have been specifically looking at the operators and eigenstates related to the z-component of spin angular momentum, denoted $S_z$. We have seen that this operator has two eigenstates,\n",

One way of interpreting these equations is to say that the action of a matrix on its eigenvectors is simply to scale the magnitude of the vector by a number (specifically, scale it by its eigenvalue).  This is a very special situation, because typically speaking, when a vector is multiplied by a matrix, the result is a new vector that points along a new direction and has a different magnitude.  For a lovely explanation with graphical illustrations, please consult [this vide](https://youtu.be/PFDu9oVAE-g).  In fact, the entire 3b1b series on linear algebra is wonderful!\n",
